# 🌾 Climate-Driven Optimization of Barley Sourcing in France

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **data-driven decision framework** to optimize barley sourcing in France under future climate conditions.

Using historical yield data, climate projections, and machine learning, the workflow estimates future production patterns and identifies how sourcing allocation should adapt to maintain supply reliability and reduce climate risk.

The model translates projected production changes into **actionable allocation adjustments** for procurement, logistics, and risk management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict future barley yields under climate change scenarios  
- Estimate future production by department  
- Identify regional shifts in supply potential  
- Optimize sourcing allocation to improve resilience  
- Quant​ify supply redistribution needs over time  

---

## 🧠 Key Questions Addressed
- Which regions will remain reliable barley suppliers?
- Where will production decline due to climate stress?
- How should sourcing allocation evolve?
- How much supply should shift between regions?
- When should sourcing adjustments begin?

---

## 🗺️ Why This Matters
Climate change is reshaping agricultural productivity. Procurement strategies based on historical patterns may increase supply risk.

This project provides a **forward-looking sourcing strategy** that:

✔ improves supply security  
✔ reduces climate exposure  
✔ supports long-term planning  
✔ enables proactive contract & logistics adjustments

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Climate Data Processing
Daily climate projections are transformed into agronomically relevant indicators:

- temperature & precipitation metrics  
- heat stress days  
- drought indicators  
- frost events  
- climate variability measures  

---

### 2️⃣ Yield Modeling
A machine learning model (**Random Forest**) is trained on historical data to learn climate–yield relationships and predict future yields.

---

### 3️⃣ Future Production Estimation
Predicted yields are converted into department-level production projections for **2027–2050**.

---

### 4️⃣ Sourcing Optimization
Departments are ranked by future production potential and grouped into tiers.

Allocation shares are optimized to:

- increase expected secured production  
- control volatility risk  
- limit over-concentration risk  

---

### 5️⃣ Allocation Transition Analysis
The project produces:

- allocation change trajectories  
- time-series sourcing adjustments  
- regional gain/loss maps  
- recommended reallocation flows
